# workout_app
### This app is designed to display the workout of the day and to allow you to toggle between each progression. The overall goal of the workout program is to help me acheive my goal of doing 100 pushups, 40 pullups, 100 ATG squats, and to build a 6-mile running base. For each movement, there is a progression associated with it that starts with a beginner movement, then advances as time passes. For the full body and endurance progressions, they will advance only on associated days. 

### Below is daily-workout-split and the progressions for each movement. 
*Note: Currently, the progressions only include exercises that will imporve my strength. After I complete each progression, I will add exercises to slowly increase the reps I am able to complete in one set. I first, need to figure out what that specific progression consists of.*
